# Counting-k-mers-with-Bloom-filters-
 How can Bloom filters be used to efficiently focus on k-mers appearing four or more times, and how do you determine the number of hash functions (l) and the size of Bloom filters (b) for n = 1 billion k-mers? Additionally, how would you implement this using PyBloom_live?
